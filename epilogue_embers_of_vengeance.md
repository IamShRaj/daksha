# Epilogue: Embers of Vengeance

One Year Later

The jungle had changed since the Velorian invasion. Or perhaps it was Prince who had changed, his perception altered by the power that now flowed through his veins, by the memories that were not his own yet lived within him.

He walked the familiar path to the clearing with the fallen log—their clearing—with steps that barely disturbed the undergrowth. His body moved differently now, with a grace and lightness that sometimes startled him when he caught his reflection in mirrors or still water.

The clearing itself was transformed. Where once there had been just a small open space with a fallen log, now there stood a monument—a sculpture Prince had created in the weeks after the invasion, after Daksha's sacrifice.

It rose from the center of the clearing, a spiraling column of what appeared to be emerald glass but was in fact solidified energy—Daksha's energy, shaped by Prince's will and the power they now shared. It caught the dappled sunlight filtering through the canopy, refracting it into patterns that danced across the jungle floor.

At the base of the sculpture, words were etched in a script that no human language could capture perfectly, but which Prince had approximated as best he could:

*For Daksha — The Girl of a Thousand Stars*

*Who taught me that love grows strongest in absence*

*Who gave everything so that others might live*

*Who lives on in every act of courage, every moment of beauty*

*Every heart that dares to love across the void*

Prince sat on the fallen log, his fingers tracing the familiar contours of his journal. It was nearly full now, its pages filled with accounts of the past year—of the aftermath of the invasion, of his gradual understanding of the powers he now possessed, of his grief and healing and transformation.

"I miss you," he said aloud to the empty clearing, to the monument, to the presence he still felt within him but could no longer separate from his own consciousness. "Every day."

There was no answer, of course. There never was, not in the way he sometimes still hoped for. Daksha's consciousness had fully merged with his own in that final moment of sacrifice. What remained was her power, her knowledge, accessible to him like memories of things he had never personally experienced.

And sometimes, in dreams or in moments of extreme emotion, flashes of her—impressions, feelings, fragments of thought that felt distinctly not-his. But never her voice, never a conversation like they used to have.

Prince opened his journal to a blank page and began to write:

*One year since the invasion. One year since you saved the world—our world. One year of learning to live with your power, your memories, your absence that isn't quite absence.*

*The town has forgotten, as you said they would. The Velorian technology erased itself from human memory as the counter-resonance spread. To everyone else, there was no invasion, no rifts in reality, no moment when the world almost ended.*

*Only I remember. Only I know what you sacrificed.*

*I've been using your knowledge, your power, to help where I can. Small things, mostly. Healing injuries that would have been fatal. Guiding lost children home through the jungle. Once, stopping a flood that would have destroyed the town.*

*I'm careful, as you taught me to be. I don't let anyone see what I can do. I maintain the appearance of the ordinary boy I used to be, though that feels like a costume now, a role I'm playing.*

*Uncle Ravi has noticed changes in me. How could he not? I'm different in ways I can't always hide—the way I move, the things I know, the lack of fear. He watches me sometimes with a look I can't quite interpret. Curiosity? Concern? Perhaps a bit of both.*

*Amar and his friends leave me alone now. Something in my eyes unsettles them, though they couldn't say what. I don't mind. I have no anger left for them, no room for petty grievances in a heart that has held the stars.*

Prince paused in his writing, looking up at the monument glinting in the sunlight. The truth was, he had no room for many of the emotions that had once defined him. The loneliness, the insecurity, the sense of being invisible—all gone, burned away in the fusion with Daksha.

In their place was something both more and less than human. A perspective that spanned millennia, dimensions. A power that hummed beneath his skin like a second heartbeat. And a grief so profound, so vast that it had become a part of him, as essential as breathing.

He continued writing:

*But there's something else, something I haven't written about before. Something I'm not sure I should even acknowledge, but it grows stronger each day.*

*I can feel them, Daksha. The Velorians. Not here on Earth—the counter-resonance ensured that. But out there, across the dimensional barriers. Your people. The civilization that exiled you, that tried to destroy my world, that believes emotions are a contamination to be purged.*

*I can feel their cold perfection like a wound in the multiverse. And I want to make them pay for what they did to you. For what they've done to countless other worlds. For the beauty and love and chaos they've systematically destroyed in their quest for perfect order.*

*Is this your desire or mine? I can no longer tell. Perhaps it's both—your knowledge of their crimes combined with my human capacity for righteous anger. Whatever its source, it burns in me like a cold fire, growing stronger with each passing day.*

*The power we share—it's still growing. Still adapting to my human form, still teaching me its capabilities. Soon, I think, it will be strong enough to do what I'm considering. To open a rift of my own. To take the fight to them, to their perfect, emotionless world.*

*Would you approve, I wonder? Or would you tell me that vengeance is just another emotion to be transcended, that love should guide my actions, not anger?*

*I wish I could hear your voice, just once more. Not as an echo in my memories, but as you—separate, distinct, the being who saw me when no one else did, who loved me across dimensions.*

Prince closed his journal, a single tear falling onto the leather cover. It glowed briefly with emerald light before being absorbed into the material, leaving no trace.

He stood, approaching the monument he had created. Placing his hand on the cool, smooth surface of the solidified energy, he closed his eyes, reaching inward to the place where Daksha's consciousness had merged with his own.

"Guide me," he whispered. "Show me the right path."

For a moment, there was nothing—just the ambient sounds of the jungle, the feel of the monument beneath his palm. Then, so faintly he might have imagined it, a warmth spreading through him, a sense of presence that was both within and beyond him.

Not words, not thoughts, but a feeling—complex, multifaceted, impossible to reduce to simple terms. Love, yes, but also determination. Caution, but also courage. Forgiveness, but also justice.

Prince opened his eyes, a small smile touching his lips. "Both, then," he said softly. "Not vengeance for its own sake, but change. Transformation. The chance for your people to remember what they've lost, what they've denied themselves for so long."

The warmth intensified briefly, then faded, leaving behind a sense of rightness, of purpose that settled into Prince's bones like a physical weight.

He stepped back from the monument, his decision made. It would take time—months, perhaps years of preparation. Of learning to fully control the power he now possessed. Of understanding the dimensional physics that would allow him to breach the barriers between worlds.

But he had time. And he had Daksha's knowledge, her power, her love to guide him.

As the sun began to set, painting the jungle in shades of gold and amber that reminded him painfully of Daksha's eyes, Prince made a silent promise—to the monument, to the presence within him, to himself.

He would return to Veloria not as a destroyer, but as a catalyst. Not to bring vengeance, but awakening. To show a civilization of perfect, emotionless beings what they had sacrificed in their pursuit of order.

To bring them the most dangerous, most transformative force in the multiverse: love.

And perhaps, in doing so, to find a way to separate what had been merged, to give Daksha back her distinct consciousness without losing the connection they shared.

It was a fool's errand, perhaps. An impossible dream.

But then, Prince thought with a smile as he turned to leave the clearing, the impossible had become somewhat of a specialty for them.

Behind him, as darkness fell, the monument began to glow with its own inner light—a beacon in the night, a promise, a reminder that some connections transcend even death, even the merging of souls.

Some connections are written in the stars themselves.

And the stars, as Prince now knew, were infinite in their possibilities.

---

In the vastness of the multiverse, in a dimension far removed from Earth, a being of pure energy observed the boy in the jungle, the monument he had created, the determination that radiated from him like heat from a flame.

The being had no name, no form that could be perceived by lesser consciousnesses. It existed in the spaces between realities, in the thin membranes that separated one dimension from another.

It had watched the exile of the one called Daksha. Had watched her transformation, her discovery of the human boy, their growing bond. Had watched her sacrifice, the merging of their consciousnesses, the repulsion of the Velorian invasion.

Now it watched as the boy—no longer just a boy, but something more, something new—set his sights on Veloria itself.

If the being could have smiled, it would have. For this was exactly as it had planned, exactly as it had hoped when it guided Daksha's exile to that specific jungle, to that specific moment when a lonely boy would find her.

The Velorians believed themselves the most advanced civilization in the multiverse, the pinnacle of evolution. They did not know—could not comprehend—that they were merely pieces in a game played by beings far beyond their understanding.

Beings who had grown bored with perfect order, with predictable outcomes. Beings who introduced chaos—love, emotion, connection—into sterile systems to see what might emerge.

The boy would bring change to Veloria. Transformation. And in doing so, he would set in motion events that would ripple across the multiverse for eons to come.

The being's attention shifted, focusing more intently on the boy, on the spark of Daksha that still existed within him—separate, distinct, though he could not yet perceive it as such.

*Soon,* the being communicated, though there was no one to hear. *Soon you will understand your true purpose. The role you were always meant to play.*

*The war has only just begun.*

And in the jungle on Earth, Prince looked up suddenly, as if hearing a distant call. For a moment, his eyes glowed with an emerald light that was not quite his own.

Then the moment passed, and he continued on his way home, unaware of the cosmic forces that had shaped his destiny, that continued to watch his every move with keen interest.

Unaware that the love he carried within him—the love that had saved his world—was both more and less than he believed it to be.

Unaware that Daksha's last words to him had been both a truth and a promise:

*Find me in the stars.*
