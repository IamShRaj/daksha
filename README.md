### ðŸ’« About the Story

An emotional love story about Prince, a lonely boy who finds a magical emerald parrot named Daksha in the jungle. As their bond deepens, Prince discovers that Daksha is actually an exiled being from another dimension. Their love transcends forms, dimensions, and even death itself.

Through separation, conflict, and ultimate sacrifice, Prince and Daksha discover that once you find true love, you never let it go, even when the universe itself stands against you. Their journey takes them from first meeting to final sacrifice as they fight to save Earth from the emotionless Velorian invasion.

> _"My princess," she whispered, the words a callback to their private joke, their term of endearment._
>
> _"No doubt, Daksha," he replied, his voice steady despite his tears. "You are my princess. Kiss me."_

Experience the transformative power of love that can change not just two souls, but entire worlds.
